# Formal Specification of the æ Language

## Overview

The æ language is designed for high-level abstraction and ease of use in programming...

## Syntax

- **Variables**: Defined using the `let` keyword.
- **Functions**: Declared with the `fn` keyword.

## Semantics

- **Execution**: The program is executed in a single thread...

## Examples

1. **Variable Declaration**:
   ```ae
   let x = 10;
   ```
2. **Function Definition**:
   ```ae
   fn add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

This specification provides a foundation for understanding and implementing the æ language.
